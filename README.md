Landing Page for Drishti

Drishti is an organization and app that performs AI-based Diabetic Retinopathy diagnosis specifically for Bangladeshi patients. Our mission is to provide free, accesible early screening to areas where DR specialists are not available. With academic, clinical, and organizational support, we are able to widen the reach of our service. we are partnered with BRAC University to perform a [validation study](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CNN) on my algorithm, and we have achieved high accuracy on Bangladeshi eyes. In addition, we have developed a novel [smartphone retinal camera system](https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/Drishti-CAD) (patent application in process) which will be integrated into our clinics.

Drishti is currently used in a variety of settings to provide free screening for rural patients in Bangladesh. We are being used in the Bangladesh Eye Hospital for nurses to assist the lead Diabetic Retinopathy specialist. More importantly, we are partnered with the Sonar Bangla Foundation and are beginning a pilot run in two of their dialysis clinics. We are exporting the smartphone system for technicians to use without a need for a specialist.
